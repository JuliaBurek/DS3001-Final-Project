Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n(Are we out of the woods?)\nLooking at it now\nLast December (Last December)\nWe were built to fall apart\nThen fall back together (Back together)\nOoh, your necklace hanging from my neck\nThe night we couldn't quite forget\nWhen we decided, we decided\nTo move the furniture so we could dance\nBaby, like we stood a chance\nTwo paper airplanes flying, flying, flying\nAnd I remember thinking\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n(Are we out of the woods?)\n\nRemember when you hit the brakes too soon?\nTwenty stitches in a hospital room\nWhen you started crying, baby, I did too\nBut when the sun came up, I was looking at you\nRemember when we couldn't take the heat?\nI walked out, I said, \"I'm setting you free\"\nBut the monsters turned out to be just trees\nWhen the sun came up, you were looking at me\nYou were looking at me, ooh\nYou were looking at me\n(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)\n(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)\nI remember\n(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)\n(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)\nOh, I remember\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah, yeah)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)\n\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet?
